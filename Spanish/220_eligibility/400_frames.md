# Framerate Guidelines{id=fps}

Geometry Dash typically sets the maximum framerate to the monitor's natural refresh rate. Software that increases the framerate of the game may be used, **but the framerate must remain at or below 360FPS**. Any record with a higher framerate will be considered hacked, **even if the framerate is achieved through the monitor refresh rate.** Any player that lies about their framerate or attempts to fake an FPS counter will be banned from the list. 

Although players may use various framerates throughout their raw footage, **players are not permitted to change FPS values midway through a record.** *This is a recent change, so please be mindful of this before submitting new records!*

## FPS Counters

An FPS counter is **required for every record submitted to the list.** An FPS counter is defined as an indicator of the player's framerate that is **present and readable** throughout the entire attempt corresponding to the record. Although we will reject records that do not have an FPS counter, a player **will not be banned** unless they attempt to lie about their framerate.
