# Patching Skips

Many updates remove skips that had been accepted for records on the original version. Players should note that, per our [guidelines for skips](/guidelines/eligibility/#skips), existing records will **never be affected after a level update that fixes one or more skips**. 

The only other change that may take place is for a fixed Type II skip, in which future records that use it will no longer be accepted.
