# Records After Level Updates

An update to a level that alters its difficulty will cause all existing records for the level to be removed **if and only if the level is harder enough to be raised on the list**. All records will be maintained if the level maintains a similar difficulty or is nerfed to an easier state (e.g. WOW). 

Any update to a level intended to change its difficulty in any way will *invalidate all previous versions* for future records on the list. Previous versions for levels that receive smaller updates, such as those that fix bugs in the gameplay, will still be acceptable for list records. The only exception to this is the case of [Type II skips](/guidelines/eligibility/#skips) getting patched.

It should be noted that this guideline does not necessarily apply for the current hardest demon, because it cannot be raised any higher. Updates that increase the difficulty of the demon at #1 will be handled on a case-by-case basis in regard to keeping or removing existing records.
