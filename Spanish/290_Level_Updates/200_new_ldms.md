# New or Updated LDMs

Along with patched skips, a level may be updated to include a strong LDM or "Ultra" LDM that would not normally be accepted. 

Records that were [rejected for a strong LDM](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#custom-ldms) before such an update *will be re-considered for addition to the list* in accordance to the new LDM on the rated level.
