# Raw Footage

The submission form on this website includes a Raw Footage section in which players may include links to unedited video files for their records. Players are **required** - for every record - to provide valid raw footage in this section to support their legitimacy. Players may also include a link to raw footage in the description of the submitted video; however, please be sure to include a note directing the team member to where they may find your raw footage! 
  
To reiterate - **We *require* players to provide raw footage that follow the guidelines below for every record they submit. It is vital for players to double-check raw footage links before submitting each record, as we will reject all records that do not include valid video files. By not providing raw footage, you acknowledge that you do not have any to provide, and you recognize that your record will be rejected!**

## Definition

Raw footage is one of the most important aspects of ensuring that a record can be added to the list, so players should keep in mind the definitions and guidelines that apply to it! In general, “raw footage” is defined as the **original file taken from the player’s recording software**, without any edits, trims, or anything else modifying the file. These edits include but are not limited to trimming the video, editing in the in-game music, and compressing the file in any way.

## Censorship

If the raw footage contains any cuts or splices in the video or audio, it will usually be rendered invalid and will not be considered when evaluating the corresponding record. However, *minor edits* such as censoring or blurring personal information may be permitted. If you plan to intentionally submit edited raw footage for the purposes of censoring personal information, please **describe the situation in as much detail as necessary in the Notes section** so we can take it into account!
  
Please note that there may be some rare cases in which we would still need unedited raw footage in order to accept a record. If this is the case, **any personal information will be kept confidential** and will not influence our evaluation of the record in any way!
