# Updates to Guidelines{id=updates}

Over time, we are likely to add new guidelines detailing the criteria that a record must meet to qualify for the list. However, some records **may not fit the current submission guidelines** because they were still acceptable at the time of submission.

**The list team will almost never retroactively reject old records** following a guidelines update, because it would not be fair to the record holders who followed the guidelines in place at the time.
