# Loopholes and Exceptions

## Loopholes

Although these guidelines aim to cover a wide variety of aspects to the Demon List, these rules are not necessarily exhaustive and may require re-wording in the future. 

Any player that attempts to evade these guidelines via a loophole in the wording of any rule will be subject to the same punishment *as if that rule was broken*.

## Guideline Exceptions

Whenever a new guideline is released, we understand that players may mistakenly overlook new policies, especially in regard to record submission. 

On a case-by-case basis, the list team may decide to grant a *one-time exception* for these scenarios while explicitly informing the player of the necessary procedures to follow in the future. **Asking the team for an exception does not increase your likelihood of receiving one!**

*Players should be sure to monitor the [changelog](/guidelines/index/#changelog) for these guidelines to ensure that no important changes are missed!* Any major changes will also be announced in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M7bDDQf).
