# Level Eligibility

A level **must be rated Demon in-game** in order to be considered for placement on the Demon List. By using RobTop's rating system as a standard for list placement, we avoid the otherwise inevitable scenario of the list being filled with nearly impossible challenges or "joke" levels. At no point will there ever be a list that covers unrated levels, as it would be highly variable and difficult to maintain. 

Although the Legacy List contains levels that are easier than anything in the Extended List, a level must be considered harder than the easiest Extended List demon in order to be placed. The only way for levels to be added to the Legacy List is when a *current list demon* no longer qualifies for the top 150. 

In addition, the list focuses on levels verified **by a single player**, even if the level itself uses the 2-player gamemode. For instance, "Codependence" is a rated extreme demon but will not be placed on the list because it was verified by more than one player. 

A rated level is only guaranteed to be considered if it has a corresponding legitimate verification video. Levels with hacked verifications that remain rated may be placed as long as it has at least one legitimate victor. Level hosts may choose to identify this victor as the official verifier per [our verifier guidelines](/guidelines/listplacements/#creators).
