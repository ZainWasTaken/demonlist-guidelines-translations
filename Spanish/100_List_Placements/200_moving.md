# Moving Levels{id=movements}

Placing a level on the list often results in it receiving new victors as players attempt to beat it for list points. As such, several of the new victors may say that the level should be either raised or lowered from its initial position. If we hear of multiple victors for a level suggesting its reevaluation, we will begin to collect opinions from recent victors and add them to the initial opinion list. 

We will also begin collecting new opinions if the level receives a legitimately verified update that noticeably alters its difficulty. 

## Opinion Lists for Movements

The analysis of an [opinion list](/guidelines/listopinions) for existing list demons works similarly to how we determine new placements. However, greater caution is exercised in cases of high variation. If a placed level has split opinions (for example, several people find it underrated, while several others find it overrated) from new victors, it is unlikely that the level will be moved unless a stronger consensus appears.
