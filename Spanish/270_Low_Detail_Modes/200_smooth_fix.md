# Using the Smooth Fix{id=smooth-fix}

One common method that players use to alleviate in-game lag is to turn on the "Smooth Fix" option in the graphics settings for Geometry Dash. 

Although this option allows players to run an otherwise unstable level smoothly, this process often involves slowing the level down in compensation. A completion of a level significantly slowed by the Smooth Fix option is considered equivalent to a speedhacked completion and therefore would not be eligible for a record on the list. 

However, as long as the player does not somehow hide their use of Smooth Fix, a record rejected in this manner *will not result in the player getting banned*.
