# Custom LDMs

Some list demons may not have a built-in LDM or an LDM on the Pointercrate account. In these cases, players may choose to create their own LDMs in a copy of the level while targeting specific parts that do not run well for them. 

Players are *strongly advised* to clear any custom LDMs with the team before using them for achieving records, especially if an LDM of the corresponding level already exists. Players should note that strong level LDMs may be considered nerfs, which violates our guidelines for [gameplay changes](/guidelines/eligibility/#gameplay).

Players that need to clear an LDM with the team should **share a NoClip run of the level with us** so we can respond to your request quickly. Simply sharing an ID with the team is not recommended!
  
Players may also choose to play on a custom LDM created by someone outside of the list team, but doing so **carries the risk of a rejected record** for a heavy LDM! Even if an LDM has been approved in the past, it is always recommended to ask the list team whether it is still acceptable under current guidelines. Players should refer to the LDM spreadsheet in our [LDM Project Server](https:/discord.gg/Ua8M4YJTBw) for a list of approved LDMs.

## Custom LDM Guidelines

This subsection describes general points players should note when creating LDMs of list demons. 

For instance, a custom LDM may not *delete or otherwise alter any object that obstructs the player’s vision*. Such objects include but are not limited to fading transitions, screen flashes, and foreground decoration. 

Although no fixed limit for the amount of required detail exists, one must be careful to not allow a custom LDM to resemble a "layout" of the level. In general, *some details should be left in the block design* to avoid over-reducing the level’s decoration.

Background deletions are allowed only if their removal does not impact the visibility of the gameplay. 

If a player decides to remove the end screen for a level, they should be aware of the new length of the LDM. The length of the original level can **never be adjusted**, for any changes would artificially alter the value of any progress obtained.

## Color Changes

Occasionally, players may encounter color combinations or flashes in a list demon that cause problems to their eyesight. Although significant changes to a level’s color scheme are not allowed (they are considered nerfs), minor color changes are permitted as long as the difficulty of the level remains the same. 

These situations are evaluated on a case by case basis, so be sure to take any color change requests to a list team member!
