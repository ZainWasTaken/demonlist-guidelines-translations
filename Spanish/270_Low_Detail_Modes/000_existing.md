# Existing LDMs{id=existing-ldms}

## Built-In

Although a built-in Low Detail Mode (LDM) for a list demon may significantly decrease its difficulty, completing a level in an LDM that is built into the rated version on the servers will always be eligible for a record on the list. 

**There are no exceptions to this guideline**, and as a result, the [placement of the level](/guidelines/listopinions/#ldms) will represent the easiest method of completing the current version on the servers. This guideline also appliess to separate LDMs that creators publish for any list demon that they hosted. 

Although they should aim to reduce the difficulty as little as possible, LDMs published by the levelâ€™s creator will always remain acceptable for records, provided that they continues to match the gameplay of the rated level on the servers (along with allowed [bug fixes](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes)).

## Pointercrate Account

In addition to built-in LDMs, the list team has uploaded LDMs of several list demons on the Geometry Dash account named "Pointercrate". Records on any level published on the Pointercrate account will always be eligible for addition to the list, given that the [other eligibility requirements](/guidelines/eligibility) are satisfied. 
  
As part of our ongoing LDM project, we have archived older LDMs on a GD account named "OldPointercrate". Records using an OldPointercrate LDM will remain eligible for the list **as long as an updated version does not yet exist on the Pointercrate account!**
