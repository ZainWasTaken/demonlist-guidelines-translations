# Texture Packs and Shaders{id=texture-packs}

## Texture Packs

Any texture packs that make the gameplay of the level easier by altering decoration are prohibited for records on the list. 

Texture packs that visibly alter hitboxes (e.g. spikes, but **not** player icons) to make them perceptively easier to avoid are also disallowed.

In addition, players are not permitted to use texture packs that make the text within the in-game endscreen impossible to read.

## Shaders

A *shader* is generally defined as any external software that alters the visual appearance of the game, such as ReShade. A shader may function similarly to a texture pack if it changes the display of in-game textures, but shaders could also change certain properties (e.g. brightness, blur) of in-game colors. 

Changing the appearance of textures and colors could adversely affect the difficulty of a list demon (e.g. by making parts brighter or darker than normal), so the use of any shader is also **prohibited for records on the list.**
