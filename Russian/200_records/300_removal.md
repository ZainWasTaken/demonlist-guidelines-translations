# Manual Record Removal

In certain cases, a player may not want to be included on the stats viewer, so any player who has records on the list may request for them to be removed at any time and for any reason. 

To prevent abuse of this system, records may not be re-added to the list for *two weeks* after their removal, and records may not be removed again for *two weeks* after they are re-added.

To maintain accuracy on each level page, if the player requesting a record removal is a verifier of one or more list demons, they will still be listed as such on the level pages. However, they will remain invisible on the stats viewer.

*Please be aware that the submission form will notify you that you are banned from the stats viewer if you have requested record removal.* Although the removal is treated as a ban in the internal database, the list team does ***not*** hold requested record removal against any player in any way. The player will maintain their previous ban history if they choose to have their records re-added to the list.
