# Record Management{id=records}

This section explains the rules and guidelines players should know when completing a list demon and submitting a record for it. **Many of the frequently asked questions regarding how we handle records for the Demon List are answered within this section!**

However, it would be unreasonable to expect players to read through every point here and understand them all immediately. Even so, there are still some important rules that players need to know, especially regarding topics such as LDMs, fixing bugs, and raw footage. In addition to the links for the more specific sections, we've included a short webpage detailing the [most important information for new players](/guidelines/index/#takeaways) looking to submit a record. This link is also available at the bottom of the submission form. **By submitting a record to the list, you acknowledge that you understand the guidelines below! If you are confused regarding a particular guideline, please reach out to the list team through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/M7bDDQf)!**
