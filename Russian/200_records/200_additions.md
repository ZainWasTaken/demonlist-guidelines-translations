# Adding a Record{id=additions}

When a player submits a record on Pointercrate, it is automatically assigned an ID number based on when it was submitted. Records are generally checked by ID in ascending order to ensure the oldest submitted records are checked first. 

However, the list team may occasionally add records to the list manually. These additions are __completely independent__ from the normal process of checking records, so seeing another record getting added before yours does not necessarily mean your record was rejected. *Players can check the status of their record by re-submitting it on the submission form or by checking their profile in the [User Area](/login).*

## Under Consideration Records{id=uc}

A player may check the status of their submission and see that the record is **under consideration**. This classification means that the list team is not immediately sure whether the record is acceptable, and it **does not** necessarily mean that we're suspicious of hacking. [This section](/guidelines/eligibility/#uc-records) delineates the possible causes for this additional review, along with what you can do as a player to speed up the process. 

In many cases, the list team will reach out for additional information regarding a record marked as under consideration. *A player has **three days** to respond to each request from a list team member before their record will be automatically rejected.* However, a player may still reach out to a team member after this deadline for their record to be reconsidered.

## Rejected Records{id=rejected}
  
If a submitted record does not satisfy the submission guidelines listed here, the record will be rejected. Some of the most common reasons for rejection include invalid raw footage, a lack of audible clicks, or failing to respond to a request for additional proof within 3 days. 

When rejecting a record, the list team member checking the video will often include a **Public Note** regarding the reasons for rejection. Players can view the public notes associated with their records by viewing their submissions in the **User Area**. If you believe your record was wrongfully rejected, or if you have additional evidence to share with us, feel free to reach out to a team member - we will be happy to reconsider it!
