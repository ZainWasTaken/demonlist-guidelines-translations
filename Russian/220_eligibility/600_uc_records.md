# Under Consideration Records{id=uc-records}

Although this classification is used for records that are potentially illegitimate, the list team also marks records as Under Consideration (UC) if a certain aspect of a legitimate run may or may not quality under these eligibility guidelines. 

For instance, the record may feature a custom LDM, bug fix, or skip that requires additional verification before we can add it to the list. 

## High Suspicion 

A UC record may feature a video of considerably low quality, to the point at which a hacked completion is indistinguishable from a normal run of the level. For many reasons in addition to low quality, a record may be rejected due to high suspicion of a [hacked completion](/guidelines/eligibility/#hacks), but the player **will not be banned** unless conclusive evidence for illegitimacy is found.

As such, players are encouraged, but not required, to include strong indicators of a legitimate completion, such as moderate to high video quality, streams, and/or progress videos. *Valid raw footage is an especially important indicator of legitimacy*; it is **required for every submission** and often a significant point of reference if we become suspicious of a hacked record. Please refer to the [Raw Footage](/guidelines/rawfootage/#raw-footage) section of the guidelines for more details. 

***A player that refuses to provide evidence to support their legitimacy when requested will be assumed to have hacked one or more completions and will be consequently banned.*** If a team member requests evidence that you do not possess, the corresponding record will likely be rejected, but a player ban will not be considered unless this case repeatedly occurs.
