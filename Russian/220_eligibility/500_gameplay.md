# Gameplay Changes{id=gameplay}

In general, records are not eligible for the list if the player changed the gameplay in any way from its original state. However, [fixing bugs](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes) is an important exception to this guideline. 

If a list demon uses the in-game two-player mode, *only completions by a single player* are permitted for records on the level.

Disallowed changes to the gameplay of a level are often classified as nerfs, which could pertain to an illegal bugfix or a significant alteration of the level’s decoration. The latter case includes [strong LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes) and significant changes to a level’s color palette.

## Endscreens

A completion video that does not show the **in-game endscreen** after completing the level will not be eligible for a record on the list, unless the player provides [raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) of the completion that includes this endscreen. However, if the game crashes before the endscreen is displayed, it will serve as an exception to this rule.

In addition, a visible endscreen should be easily readable by the viewer. If the record features a [texture pack](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#texture-packs) that makes the endscreen unreadable, it will not be eligibile for the list.

## Game Version

Although these changes are typically not significant, an in-game update may alter the physics of various gamemodes, which can change the difficulty of passing certain sections of list demons. Because of this inconsistency, **any record** that was not achieved on the current version of the game or the version in which the level was verified will not be accepted to the list. Note that this guideline permits records achieved on private servers (e.g., the 1.9 GDPS) as long as the list demon was originally verified and published on the server as well.
