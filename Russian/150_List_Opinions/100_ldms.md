# Low Detail Modes{id=ldms}

In addition to these factors, sometimes a level may contain a [built-in Low Detail Mode](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#existing-ldms) that makes it significantly easier. Since all built-in LDMs are considered acceptable for list records, if the LDM makes a particular level much easier, the list team will primarily consider opinions from players that use it. This emphasis allows the list placement to correspond to the easiest "official" version of the level.
