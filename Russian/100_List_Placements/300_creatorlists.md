# Creator Lists{id=creators}

Each level page on the website features a list of creators, which consists of those considered to have made a significant contribution to the gameplay and/or decoration. In general, the list team only adds creators that created "standalone" parts for the level; their contributions must not merely append to the work of another creator. For example, a creator that makes the block design for a part in the level will likely be credited, but someone that adds glow to every decorated structure will not. This guideline applies to *both gameplay and decoration*. 

In some cases, other individuals that played a major role in the level’s development may also be credited on the creator list. This guideline includes level hosts and optimization teams, but **does not** include playtesters. Other "edge cases" in which the contribution may or may not be significant enough to qualify will be handled by the list team on a case-by-case basis.

In addition, a qualifying part for the creator list must serve as a reasonable route to complete the level in question. In general, the verification route will be the one considered "official" in regard to generating a creator list. **Some levels contain offscreen parts that have unique creators but are not featured in the level's completion route. These creators will not be credited on the level page.**

## Host Privileges

Some list demons are “megacollabs” with a designated host. If the original verifier of a list demon megacollab is removed from the stats viewer, the host of the collab has the right to change the verifier as if the level had not been released yet. A corresponding legitimate completion will be counted as a verification on the level's webpage.
